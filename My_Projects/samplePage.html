        <h1>Welcome to my web page!</h1>
        <p>This is a simple web page created using Python and it served it using my terminal python3 -m http.server command lines.</p>
        <p>Here is the answers to the questions as well:</p>
            
<p>1. What is HTTP? <br />
    <br />
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is governs how clients get data from, or send data to, a server. <br />
<br />
2. What is a URL? <br />
<br />
Short for Uniform Resource Locator, a URL is an address for some internet resource. <br />
<br />
3. What is DNS? <br />
<br />
Short for Domain Name System, this is a system that takes human-readable URLs and converts them into IP addresses.<br />
<br />
4. What is a query string?<br />
<br />
The query string allows you to pass key-value pairs into the URL, in the format ?key1=value1&key2=value2...<br />
<br />
5. List two HTTP Verbs and their use cases.<br />
<br />
GET - get some data from the server (most pages, search forms)<br />
POST - send some data to the server (pages that change data on server)<br />
<br />
6. What is an HTTP request?<br />
<br />
An HTTP request is a request from a client to a server which follows the HTTP protocol (eg a request for HTML from news.google.com)<br />
<br />
7. What is an HTTP response?<br />
<br />
An HTTP response is a response from a server to a client which follows the HTTP protocol (eg sending back HTML/CSS/JS/etc)<br />
<br />
8. What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.<br />
<br />
Headers provide additional information about the request or the response. Here are some examples:<br />
Request headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Cookie, Cache-Control<br />
Response headers: Content-Type, Last-Modified, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control<br />
<br />
9. What happens when you type a URL in a browser?<br />
<br />
Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS<br />
Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and other things)<br />
The server sends a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was sucessful)<br />
The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc)<br />
The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each<br />
